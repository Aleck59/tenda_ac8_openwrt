 *      bit15 rsv | [14:10] DDDDD | [9:5] SSSSS | [4:1] reason | [0] ACL-mirror flag

 * ⚠ But every Realtek L34 test sets this bit BEFORE reading why2cpu, i.e. that table
 * describes the 51B encoding. This driver writes SWTCR1 absolutely as 0x2200, leaving
 * bit 8 CLEAR, so our captured 0x0c03/0x0c09/0x0c20 are in the LEGACY encoding and the

 * NAPT is never attempted. That is exactly what the decoded trap reason shows
 * (WAN ingress: SSSSS=19 RP, DDDDD=19 RP).
 *
 * We store externalIP as htonl(ip) -- justified for the NAPT row HASH, which keys on
 * on-wire fields -- but the extIP TABLE comparison may want the plain host-order word.
 * The readback comment in gw_prog has always said "want w1=ac100001" while the register

 *   aa:bb:cc:00:00:03 FID:1 mbr(4 ) FWD     (WAN peer,   its jack)
 * while this port wrote every peer entry with 0x3f (flood ports 0-5, "the VID picks
 * the jack"). A routed unicast cannot be hardware-forwarded to a flood mask -- the
 * ASIC has no single egress port to commit to -- which is exactly the observed
 * signature: the L4 NAPT row matches and reloads its age, yet every packet is still
 * delivered to the CPU.
 *
 * ★ With CPU-tag mode the jacks ARE real SoC ports, so these carry stock's real
 * per-jack numbers: LAN = 0x04 (jack 2, the host) and WAN = 0x10 (jack 4, the WAN
 * peer). That is what makes hardware forwarding possible at all -- measured 891/906
 * Mbit with 0.0%% of payload bytes crossing the CPU.
 *
 * Per-side, because the two peers live on DIFFERENT jacks: stock's L2 shows the LAN
 * client at mbr(2) and the WAN peer at mbr(4). A single shared mask cannot be right
 * for both (proved: forcing 0x10 on both sends LAN return traffic out the WAN jack
 * and kills connectivity). Board layout: WAN = jack 4, LAN = jacks 0-3.
 *
 * HISTORICAL: under Fork A all jacks sat behind the RGMII trunk and the SoC saw only
 * SoC port 0, so 0x01 was the only single-port value that worked and 0x3f was the old
 * flood. The note that once stood here -- "a routed unicast can never resolve to
 * anything but the trunk" -- was true ONLY of Fork A and is now disproven; do not
 * carry it forward. Still runtime-tunable so a mask can be swept without a rebuild. */

	/* ── R6/B1: the WAN CONNECTED route, in stock's shape ────────────────────────
	 * ★★★ This is the leading hypothesis for why inbound (WAN->LAN) reverse-NAPT
	 * never engages, and it comes from diffing stock's route construction against
	 * ours rather than from guessing another mode bit.
	 *
	 * The problem: nothing here matches the box's OWN masquerade IP (the extIP,
	 * 172.16.0.1). It therefore falls through to the catch-all [6]/[7], which are
	 * `process=5 (NxtHop), internal=0`. This port has ALREADY PROVEN on hardware
	 * what that does (commit 9562db2): a WAN->LAN reply whose dst is the extIP
	 * matches a process=5/internal=0 route, gets classified OUTBOUND, and so never
	 * reaches the inbound reverse-NAPT stage at all. The /24 was narrowed to a /32
	 * to kill that shadow — and then [6]/[7] re-introduced exactly the same shadow,
	 * which is why inbound has not worked since.
	 *
	 * Stock never has that shadow. For an ethernet netif with a connected subnet the
	 * vendor always uses process=RT_ARP(2), never RT_NEXTHOP(5)
	 * (l3Driver/rtl865x_route.c:621-653): it sets process=RT_ARP, allocates a real
	 * ARP range, and stores ARPIpIdx = the ext/int-IP table row for that subnet. So
	 * on stock the subnet CONTAINING the box's own WAN IP is process=2/internal=0
	 * and the extIP-table dst-match drives reverse-NAPT.
	 *
	 * Restored here at idx3 — more specific than [6]/[7], less specific than the
	 * peer /32 at idx0, so the proven forward path is untouched (route[0] still wins
	 * for 172.16.0.2).
	 *
	 * ⚠ ARPStart/ARPEnd are stored SHIFTED >>3 (asicL3.c:190-191), so 0..31 here
	 * means raw ARP rows 0..255 — which is what stock's live route reads back as
	 * (ARPSTART 0 / ARPEND 248). The existing value was already stock-equivalent.
	 *
	 * ⚠ Companion gap NOT fixed here (R6/B2): stock tears NAPT rows down with the
	 * ARP entry because a process=2 route DROPS unless its ARP range holds a
	 * resolved entry for the destination. This port programs exactly one ARP row
	 * (64 = the WAN peer) and none for any LAN host, so after a reverse-NAPT hit the
	 * dst becomes 192.168.0.2 and there is no HW path to it — route[1] is process=1
	 * and traps to the CPU instead. Placing that entry needs the ASIC's ARP hash,
	 * which is not yet decoded (a previous attempt at static ARP rows made frames
	 * drop outright). So B1 alone may move the classification without yet giving a
	 * fully HW-forwarded return path.
	 *
	 * Runtime knob, default OFF, because this rewrites a slot on the proven forward
	 * datapath. A/B it in one boot:
	 *   echo 1 > /sys/module/rtl819x/parameters/wan_connected_route
	 *   cat /proc/rtl865x_gw >/dev/null        # re-runs gw_prog
	 * R6 signal: eth0.1 rx_packets delta during a sustained inbound transfer
	 * collapsing toward 0 (measure warm; see bench confound #5).

/* ---- AP/bridge role: invalidate a stale L2 row for a station -----------------
 * WHY (measured 2026-08-23 on a DIR-842 R1 used as a dumb AP):
 * While a station is associated to a DIFFERENT AP on the same LAN, its frames
 * reach this box over the wire and the switch HARDWARE-LEARNS that MAC on the
 * uplink jack (member=0x01 — no software writer here produces that value;
 * l2_mask_lan is 0x04, l2_mask_wan 0x10). When the station later associates
 * HERE it lives behind the CPU, but the stale row still points at the jack, so
 * downstream unicast is sent to the jack and then source-port-filtered out
 * (rtl819x_swnic.c:622-635) — silently dropped. Upstream and broadcast keep
 * working, so the client associates and even completes IPv6 SLAAC, but gets no
 * DHCP OFFER/ACK and no ARP replies, while the wired path stays perfect.
 *
 * In router role gw_prog freezes L2 aging (TEACR bit0) and the row NEVER
 * expires. In bridge role aging runs and it self-heals — measured ~5 MINUTES,
 * useless in an 802.11r roaming domain. Hence an explicit invalidate:
 *
 *   echo aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff > /proc/rtl865x_l2flush   (that station, all fids)
 *   echo all               > /proc/rtl865x_l2flush   (every LEARNED row)
 *
 * ★ TABLE GEOMETRY (this bit an earlier version of this code): the L2 table is
 * 256 ROWS x 4 WAYS = 1024 entries, addressed idx = (row<<2)|way. gw_l2_row()
 * masks the hash & 0xFF, and gw_dump_show dumps ASIC_TYPE_L2_SWITCH 0..1023.
 * Iterating "rows" 0..1023 would emit idx up to 4092 and, since each type
 * window holds 2048 entries, would run off the end of the L2 window straight
 * into ASIC_TYPE_ARP — zeroing ARP rows including the WAN nexthop. Bound every
 * loop by L2_ENTRIES.
 *
 * ★ WAYS: hardware learning may place a MAC in ANY of the 4 ways, so we must
 * scan all four and match, not assume way 0.
 *
 * ★ NEVER touch driver-written rows: gw_write_l2()/gw_write_l2_full() set
 * STA(1<<18) and NH(1<<22) on the nexthop/broadcast/CPU-trap entries that the
 * routed datapath and CPU delivery depend on. Hardware-learned rows have both
 * clear (verified against live dumps). Skipping them makes this safe to run in
 * router role too, which matters because router role is where the stale row is
 * PERMANENT.
